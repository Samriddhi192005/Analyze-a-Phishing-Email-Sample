# Analyze-a-Phishing-Email-Sample
TASK 2: Analyze a Phishing Email Sample. 

1.	A SAMPLE PHISHING EMAIL:
From: "Apple Support" <support@apple.com>
Reply-To: security@apple-id-recovery.com
To: user@example.com
Subject: Urgent: Your Apple ID Has Been Locked
Date: Tue, 18 Jun 2024 14:21:53 -0700
Return-Path: <mailer@appleid-verification-alert.net>
Received-SPF: fail (appleid-verification-alert.net: domain of mailer@appleid-verification-alert.net does not designate 185.234.217.101 as permitted sender)
Authentication-Results: dkim=fail dmarc=fail

2.	Examine Sender's Email Address for Spoofing
Header Values:
From: "Apple Support" <support@apple.com>
Reply-To: security@apple-id-recovery.com
Return-Path: mailer@appleid-verification-alert.net

Issues:
‚Ä¢	Display name is "Apple Support", but Return-Path and Reply-To domains differ.
‚Ä¢	Return-Path domain is not apple.com ‚Äî it is appleid-verification-alert.net, a lookalike domain.

Verdict: Highly suspicious. Legitimate Apple emails come from verified Apple servers/domains only.

3.	Check Email Headers for Discrepancies
Header Authentication Results:
Received-SPF: fail
Authentication-Results: dkim=fail dmarc=fail
Analysis:
‚Ä¢	SPF failed: sending server isn't allowed by domain policy.
‚Ä¢	DKIM and DMARC both failed: sender authenticity cannot be verified. 

Verdict: Clear spoofing or use of lookalike domain. 

4.	Identify Suspicious Links or Attachments
Link in Body:
http://appleid-verification-alert.net/restore
Suspicious Indicators:
‚Ä¢	Domain is not apple.com
‚Ä¢	Uses HTTP (not secure HTTPS)
‚Ä¢	Domain is designed to mimic Apple ID branding
‚Ä¢	Could lead to a credential harvesting site

Attachments: None in this sample

Verdict: Link is clearly malicious or fraudulent

5.	Look for Urgent or Threatening Language
Sample Phrases from Body:
‚Ä¢	"We have temporarily locked your account for your protection."
‚Ä¢	"Failure to verify within 24 hours will result in permanent suspension"

Analysis:
‚Ä¢	Classic phishing tactic: create panic
‚Ä¢	Forces user to act quickly without thinking

Verdict: Strong use of urgency and fear

6.	Note Any Mismatched URLs (Hover Technique)
Visible text: [Verify Now](http://appleid-verification-alert.net/restore)
Hover link: does not match Apple‚Äôs actual site

Legitimate Apple link would be:
https://appleid.apple.com

Verdict: Mismatch confirms phishing

7.	Verify Presence of Spelling or Grammar Errors
Observations:
‚Ä¢	Language is mostly clean, but:
o	Slightly off tone: ‚Äúfor your protection‚Äù + ‚Äúsecure link below‚Äù = generic phrasing
o	Missing personal info (e.g., user‚Äôs name)

Verdict: No glaring grammar errors, but tone is generic and unprofessional for Apple


8.	Summary of Phishing Traits Found:
